# Agile timer

Tired of those long, dragged out and boring stand ups. This is a simple timer built in React to help keep people on track with how long they have to talk.

1. Set the time using the input fields for minutes and seconds.
2. Enter or Space to start/restart the timer.
3. Escape to finish the meeting and get your stats.
